## Social Network Using MongoDB

# About

### Social networking platforms have become some of the most consumed and important technologies by virtually every user. As you may guessed it the foundation of these applications is data. MongoDB is among the most popular systems to store data. It is a open source, non-relational database management system (DBMS) that instead of storing data with tables and rows it stores them as documents. I'll be using MongoDB to built a Social Network.

# 2. User Story

```md
GIVEN a social network API
WHEN I enter the command to invoke the application
THEN my server is started and the Mongoose models are synced to the MongoDB database 
WHEN I open API GET routes in Insomnia for users and thoughts
THEN the data for each of these routes is displayed in a formatted JSON
WHEN I test API POST, PUT, and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create, update, and delete users and thoughts in my database
WHEN I test API POST and DELETE routes in Insomnia
THEN I am able to successfully create and delete reactions to thoughts and add and remove friends to a user’s friend list
```


# 3. How to use

### With this command-line application you''ll run command `npm run start` and then you can use either Insomia or an extension like Thunder Client to test the api routes.
